Need to work on making the errors in the controllers more robust (like actually throwing error codes) so that the errors are properly accounted for

I've finished the basis for the customer conttroller and model. Next I have to do workers (which will be much easier) as well as the calendar

Then I need to make the frontend 

Finally I have to ensure everything works


(Note for react-redux: Need to figure out how to persist in the new react update since I'm getting an error)

List of paths completed: 
(Most of) Index (just need to get that workers things setup, but until I actually do the workers section, I can't so for now this is it)

I really should make it so that everything that's contact should be customer. I hate how confusing it is but customer is the correct term
