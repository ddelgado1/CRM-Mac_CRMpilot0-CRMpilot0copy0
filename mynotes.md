Need to make it so that we have a proper join table with cascading (most likely) (need to figure out how to get this working [probably stack exchange])

## Frontend:

- General
    - Update redux to toolkit
    - For database.js in /wbwcrm-backend/util, need to make an environment variable for password rather than having it in plaintext
    - Figure out why, suddenly, calendar isn't rendering unless I resave my file

- Contacts
    - Index
        - Done!
    - New
        - Done!
    - Show 
        - Gotta make it so that the current customer is saved in session so we don't need to worry about them reloading the page and having it be blank
    - Search 
        - Done!

- Workers
    - Done!

- Calendar
    - Just have to do the create event thing then we're done!
    - Also need to implement recurring events in my calendarDisplay component

Back end:

Done!
