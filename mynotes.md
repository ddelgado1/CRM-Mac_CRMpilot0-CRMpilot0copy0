Need to work on making the errors in the controllers more robust (like actually throwing error codes) so that the errors are properly accounted for

## Frontend:

- General
    - Need to setup Redux persist and navigation in general
    - Admin rights
    - Need to beef up our validators so that people can't change things with inspect element
    - Need to make error stuff better

- Contacts
    - Index
        - Done!
    - New
        - Need to get rid of errors on page change (only did it for contacts, need to also do it for the other two)
    - Show 
        - Gotta make it so that the current customer is saved in session so we don't need to worry about them reloading the page and having it be blank
    - Search 
        - Gotta set it up (since it's all frontend, it's just a matter of setting up a search page then using the filter feature on the table)

- Workers
    - Need to work on all of it 

- Calendar
    - Need to work on all of it

Back end:

- Workers
    - All of it
